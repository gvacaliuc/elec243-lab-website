# Introduction

The instruments we have used so far (DMM, oscilloscope, function generator) are
very good at what they do (measure voltages and currents, produce and display
waveforms) but can seldom be made to do anything beyond what they were designed
to do. This week we will begin to use the programmability of the Lab PC, along
with its data acquisition capability, to create flexible new instruments to
perform tasks that our conventional ones cannot.
