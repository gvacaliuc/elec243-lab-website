Cleaning Up
-----------

The final phase of *any* experiment is cleaning up. *Prior to disassembling
your experiment, turn off the power on each instrument, including the
VirtualBench.*  

If the apparatus did not work during the experiment, let a labbie/instructor
know and find an equipment repair label and attach it to the instrument. Return
all patch cords, clip leads, and your DMM to their proper locations in the
equipment room.  Turn off bench lights, and dispose of any stripped wire bits.
The goal of cleaning up is to leave the lab and the equipment room more
organized than you found it.  

Make sure to put away all equipment, especially in later labs when equipment is
in high demand. **DO NOT** store public lab equipment such as microphones,
speakers, and phones in your lockers. (The labbies can take off points for
this.)
