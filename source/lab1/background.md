# Accuracy, Precision, and Resolution of Measurement Instruments 

#### Accuracy 

There is no such thing as an absolutely accurate or a perfect measurement. A
measurement's *accuracy* represents how closely it represents the actual
value.  Instruments themselves obey physical laws and usually interact with the
phenomenon being measured, limiting measurement accuracy. Using a Digital
Multimeter (DMM) as an example, accuracy is often stated as some percentage of
the actual measurement, or as a percentage of the full scale measurement. For
example, the Hewlett-Packard DMM has a specified accuracy of ${\pm}0.3\%$
for DC voltage measurements, $1%$ for DC current, $2%$ for AC voltage and
current, and $0.7%$ for resistance.  Tables of these accuracies are usually
published in operating manuals.

#### Resolution 

The smallest measurable change that can be detected
is resolution. The DMM has a resolution of one least significant digit.
The resolution of the scope and function generator depends on how good
your eyesight is. Something on the order of $0.5%$ would be typical.

#### Precision 

Precision specifies an instrument's ability to repeat
a given measurement. If you measure a resistance using the ohmmeter mode
on the DMM and then come back a few minutes later, you should record the
same value for the resistance. However, instruments can drift and the
stability of the measured phenomenon may be in question.
