### Components

-   [Photodiode](../figs/photo_diode.jpg)
-   [Red Light Emitting Diode](../figs/red_led.jpg)

Last week we used the photodiode to measure the ambient illumination
level and other apparantly DC values. In fact the light in the lab has a
significant AC component whose frequency is faster than our eyes can
perceive. By using the oscilloscope to observe the photodiode output
signal, we can separate the AC and DC components of the light level.

With certain materials, the process by which the photodiode converts
photons to electrons can be run in reverse, converting electricity to
light. The photodiode we are using is made of silicon, which is not one
of those materials. However, in our parts kit are a number of diodes
which are made out of such a material (e.g. gallium phosphide) which can
convert electrons to photons. These diodes are called, somewhat
unimaginatively, *light emitting diodes* or *LEDs*.

### Part 1: The Photodiode

#### Step 1:

Set up the oscilloscope to display 0.2V/div and time/div to 2ms.

#### Step 2:

Connect the short lead (cathode) of the
[photodiode](../figs/photo_diode.jpg) to ground and the long lead (anode)
to `CH1` of the scope. You can use the BNC clip leads for this, but a
better way (which leaves your hands free) is to plug it into the
breadboard and wire it to the socket strip on the [interface
board](../unilab/interface.html#interface_socket). (With the interface
board connected as described above, pin 1 will be `CH1` and pin 14 will
be ground.)

#### Step 3:

Under CH1 settings set the vertical offset to 0V to establish the zero
reference. Return the switch to the `DC` position.

#### Step 4:

Note the voltage produced by the photodiode. How does it change when you
cover the photodiode with your hand.

#### Step 5:

Repeat the previous two steps using as a source the under-shelf
florescent lamp. Sketch (or take a screenshot) of the shape of the AC
component of the waveform. What is its amplitude and frequency?

#### Question 3:

Explain the waveforms you observed in the previous Step.

### Part 2: Measuring Photocurrent

The physics behind the operation of the photodiode says that the
*current* produced by the diode should be directly proportional to the
irradiance of the incident light (ideally one electron of current
produced for each photon of light absorbed). We might hope that the
voltage would also be proportional to the irradiance, but as our
measurements last week suggested, this is not the case.

Since the oscilloscope (and the Lab PC) can only display voltage, we
need to convert the current produced by the photodiode (called
*photocurrent*) to a voltage in order to make quantitative measurements.
We will find more sophisticated ways of doing this later, but for now
the only technique we have is to send the current through a resistor and
allow Ohm's law to give us a proportional voltage.

|                          |                          | of the LED and the       |
|                          |                          | voltage across it.       |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 5:             |                          | Disconnect the BNC cable |
|                          |                          | from the power supply    |
|                          |                          | and connect it to the    |
|                          |                          | `Main Output` of the     |
|                          |                          | function generator.      |
|                          |                          | Leave the other end      |
|                          |                          | connected to J1-3 of the |
|                          |                          | Interface board.         |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 6:             |                          | Set the function         |
|                          |                          | generator to product a   |
|                          |                          | 100Â Hz square wave. Make |
|                          |                          | sure the -20dB           |
|                          |                          | Attenuator is IN and set |
|                          |                          | the amplitude to         |
|                          |                          | minimum.                 |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 7:             |                          | Increase the function    |
|                          |                          | generator amplitude      |
|                          |                          | until the LED begins to  |
|                          |                          | glow. Is the glow        |
|                          |                          | steady?                  |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 8:             |                          | Slowly reduce the        |
|                          |                          | frequency of the         |
|                          |                          | function generator. At   |
|                          |                          | what frequency does the  |
|                          |                          | appearance of steady     |
|                          |                          | glow stop and noticeable |
|                          |                          | flicker begin?           |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Question 4:         |                          | How does the number you  |
|                          |                          | measured in the previous |
|                          |                          | step relate to the frame |
|                          |                          | rate of television and   |
|                          |                          | motion pictures?         |

### Part 4: Optical Communication, Take 1

In Part 1 we measured environmental light sources over which we have
little control. In Part 2 we were able to create an optical signal
containing whatever information we chose (or at least whatever we could
get the function generator to produce). By combining the components of
both Parts we can create an optical communication link.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 1:             |                          | Disconnect the BNC patch |
|                          |                          | cord from `CH1` of the   |
|                          |                          | scope and connect the    |
|                          |                          | BNC clip leads. Connect  |
|                          |                          | the photodiode to the    |
|                          |                          | clip leads.              |

|                          |                          | )                        |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 2:             |                          | With the LED still       |
|                          |                          | connected to the         |
|                          |                          | function generator as in |
|                          |                          | the previous part, set   |
|                          |                          | the frequency to 100Â Hz. |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 3:             |                          | Hold the photodiode      |
|                          |                          | (pointing down) above    |
|                          |                          | the LED (pointing up).   |
|                          |                          | Adjust their relative    |
|                          |                          | positions to maximize    |
|                          |                          | the signal displayed on  |
|                          |                          | the scope. (It may help  |
|                          |                          | to shield the components |
|                          |                          | from ambient light with  |
|                          |                          | your hand.) Describe the |
|                          |                          | waveform. Is it what you |
|                          |                          | would expect?            |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 4:             |                          | Set the function         |
|                          |                          | generator to produce a   |
|                          |                          | triangle wave. Sketch    |
|                          |                          | the waveform you see on  |
|                          |                          | the scope. Is it what    |
|                          |                          | you expected? Can you    |
|                          |                          | explain it?              |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| #### Step 5:             |                          | Reset the function       |
|                          |                          | generator to produce a   |
|                          |                          | square wave. Slowly      |
|                          |                          | separate the photodiode  |
|                          |                          | from the LED, adjusting  |
|                          |                          | the alignment to         |
|                          |                          | maintain the best        |
|                          |                          | signal. What is the      |
|                          |                          | maximum distance over    |
|                          |                          | which you can transmit a |
|                          |                          | recognizable signal.     |
|                          |                          | Hint: switch the scope   |
|                          |                          | to the `AC` position and |
|                          |                          | increase the gain.       |
