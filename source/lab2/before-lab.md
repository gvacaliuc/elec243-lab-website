# Before Lab

Last week we were able to use banana patch cords to make the connections we
required. The components we will be using this week don't have banana
connectors. Instead we will be using [BNC
cables](../misc_images/#bnc-patch-cables) and the *breadboard* and *interface
modules* to make connections.

You will need to refer to the breadboard and interface modules (in the
[Lab Station Handbook](../lab-home/lab-station-handbook)) for this lab.
