# Introduction

Welcome to the ELEC 243 Lab, the real world companion to the ELEC 243
lectures.

### The Grand Plan

We have a number of lofty goals for this lab. Our ultimate goal is the
transmission and processing of information and our vehicle for that
information will be the signal. Along the way we will study how signals
carry information, how they arise in circuits and systems, how to
characterize them, and how they interact with the components that make
up information systems. Finally we will give you a chance to do what
engineers do: to put it all together in the design, construction, and
analysis of a biosignals measurement system.

### The Laboratory Schedule

Here's what we have to do:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

| **Date** | **Laboratory** |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Week 1   | No Lab |
| Week 2   | No Lab |
| Week 3   | Lab 1: Basic Electrical Measurements |
| Week 4   | Lab 2: AC Signals and Measurements |
| Week 5   | Lab 3: Computer Aided Measurements I |
| Week 6   | Lab 4: Computer Aided Measurements II |
| Week 7   | Lab 5: Op Amps I |
| Week 8   | Lab 6: Op Amps II |
| Week 9   | Lab 7: Transducer Amplifiers |
| Week 10  | No Lab - Spring Break |
| Week 11  | Lab 8: Signal Processing |
| Week 12  | Lab 9: Designing a Pulse Oximeter |
| Week 13  | Lab 9 cont'd |
| Week 14  | Lab 9 cont'd |
| Week 15  | Lab 9 cont'd |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Lab Groups

In lab (and outside lab as well) you will work in a team of two or three people,
and responsibilities should be shared across all members. Lab grades
will be given on a per group basis, rather than individually.
