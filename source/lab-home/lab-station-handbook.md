# Lab Station Handbook

In the lab we will construct systems by combining the lab instruments
(i.e., function generator, oscilloscope, and power supply) and "virtual
instruments" running on the Lab PC with components that we wire together
to make circuits. To do this we need to be able to make several types of
connections.

The instruments have either banana jacks or BNC connectors. The Lab PC
has stereo jacks and a ribbon cable connector. Most of our components
have wire pins or leads, but some of the larger ones have their own
cables with connectors. Our basic strategy will be to wire the small
components together on a breadboard, and then use cables with
appropriate connectors to bring signals from the instruments, Lab PC,
and large components to the breadboard.

The breadboard is a grid of holes or connection points where you can
make electrical connections between components and construct circuits.
Our lab breadboard consists of a region with unconnected holes where you
can build your circuits. However, the upper region of your breadboard is
the called breadboard interface module, where there each column is
internally connected to the different types of terminals you see on the
modules. This allows you to interface your circuits with the instruments
and lab PC.
