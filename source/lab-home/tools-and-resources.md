# Tools and Resources

If you look over the labs we have planned, it's clear that there's a
considerable amount of work to be done. Fortunately we have a
substantial collection of tools available to make this an efficient
process. These include the materials used to build the circuits, tools
to assemble them, instruments to analyze them, data analysis software,
and of course documentation.

In this chapter we will take a brief inventory of the tools and
resources we have available. A complete list, with more detailed
descriptions, is contained in *The UNILAB User's Manual*.

### Instruments

Each station is equipped with a VirtualBench, which will work as power
supply, oscilloscope, and function generator. It will also work as a
digitial multimeter (DMM), but a handheld digital multimeter is
available for each station, kept in the equipment room.

### Components

Each lab group will get a kit containing an assortment of resistors,
capacitors, and semiconductors. These should be sufficient to build all
the circuits we will study this semester, but if not additional
components are available in the equipment room. Larger components, such
as microphones, speakers, handsets, etc., are also kept in the equipment
room, and must be left there between lab sessions, as we only have
enough for each day's lab groups. Do not keep equipment such as
microphones in your locker!

### Interconnects

There are two kinds of things we will need to connect: components to
each other to make circuits and instruments to circuits (and to each
other) to measure signals.

#### Patch Cords

Patch cords are lengths of cable a foot or so long with a connector on
each end. We have two kinds: with [banana plugs](../misc_images/#banana-adapter) for
connecting to the power supply and DMM, and with [BNC
connectors](../misc_images/#bnc-t) for connecting to the oscilloscope and
function generator. We also have [BNC clip leads](../misc_images/#bnc-cliplead)
for connecting instruments directly to components, but the interface
module provides an easier way to do this in most cases.

#### The Breadboard

Each lab group will be issued a breadboard and interface board. You may
take these home with you between labs, or leave them in the equipment
room, as you choose. In any event, place a label (also available in the
equipment room) with the names of your group members and your lab day on
the underside of the breadboard and on the back side of the interface
board. The breadboard and interface board must be returned, in usable
condition, at the end of the semester.

### Tool Kit

Each student will be given a kit containing tools that will be useful in
building circuits in the lab. It includes wire cutters, wire strippers,
needle nose pliers, a chip puller, and a small screwdriver for adjusting
trimpots. It also includes a BNC T connector and banana plug adapter for
making interconnections with patch cords. These tools will be useful in
several of your other lab courses, so try to hang onto them.

### Lab PC

Each lab station has a Dell DX280 PC running Windows XP. It is connected
to the network so you may access your OwlSpace directory and your
favorite web sites. In addition to the regular complement of features it
contains a *data acquisition* card, allowing it to measure and produce
signals in the circuits you will be building. Networked printing is
available from the printer (printer name "ink") in the equipment room
(A143).
