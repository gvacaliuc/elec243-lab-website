# Patch Cords and Cables

A patch cord is a length of cable with a connector on each end. We have two
different types: banana plug patch cords to connect the DC Power Supply to the
breadboard and BNC patch cords to connect the other instruments to each other
and to the breadboard interface module.

There are two accessories to increase the flexibility of the patch cords: the
BNC to banana adapter and the BNC T connector. The [BNC to banana plug
adapter](../misc_images/#banana-adapter) allows a BNC cable to be connected to a
pair of banana jacks. Note the ground bump on one side of the adapter; this
denotes which banana plug prong is connected to the outer (ground) conductor of
the BNC connector. The [BNC T connector](../misc_images/#bnc-t) allows two BNC
cables to be plugged into the same connector.

There are two dedicated cables that connect the Lab PC to the breadboard. One
has several phone plugs on one end to plug into the sound card and an 8-pin DIN
connector to plug into J2-1 of the interface module. The other is a 50-pin
ribbon cable to connect the interface module to the data acquisition card.
