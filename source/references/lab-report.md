ELEC 243 Lab

Your Lab Report
===============

A lab report serves several functions. In industry it serves as a legal
document to establish priority of invention in patent disputes. While we
don't expect many patentable discoveries to come out of 243 Lab, you
should develop good lab report habits in case you should go to work for
a company that does have such expectations.

In scientific research, it provides a record that allows you to
duplicate your work if you succeed at your endeavor (or if you achieve
some unexpected but significant result). It's also useful in identifying
what might have gone wrong if you don't achieve your desired result.

In an educational environment, we have some additional goals. The lab
report provides a mechanism for evaluating your performance.

### The Report Itself

Each lab group will turn in a single report into the window dropbox in
Abercrombie A141. Lab reports may be written in Word or LaTeX. Both
templates will be provided.
