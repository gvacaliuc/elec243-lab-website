ELEC 243 Lab

Introduction
============

This week we will add a number of words to our Labview vocabulary. We
will generate outputs in addition to reading and displaying inputs. We
will deal with streams of continuous samples as well as single, discrete
samples. We will introduce some simple *signal processing*. And we will
display our results in graphic as well as numeric form. We will apply
some of these techniques to the resistance/temperature measurement
system we built last week to produce a new system with increased
accuracy and capability.
