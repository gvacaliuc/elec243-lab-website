Introduction
============

Last week we looked at several op-amp circuits for amplifying voltages.
While there are many things you can do with a voltage amplifier, there
are also many things that you can't. In particular, the optoelectronic
transducers we studied in Lab 2 have nonlinear behavior in terms of
their voltages, but very linear behavior in terms of current. To
effectively utilize these, we will need amplifiers which accept and
deliver currents rather than voltages.
