# Lab 6: Op Amps II

### [Introduction](./introduction)

### Organizing Your Breadboard

Last week we had some generic guidelines on using your breadboard to build op
amp circuits. This week we need to consider the organization of the breadboard
at a higher level.

We will be reusing the transducer amplifier for a later lab, so build it in a
corner of the breadboard and don't take it apart at the end of lab.

### Experiments
