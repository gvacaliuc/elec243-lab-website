Organizing Your Breadboard
--------------------------

Last week we had some generic guidelines on using your breadboard to
build op amp circuits. This week we need to consider the organization of
the breadboard at a higher level.

We will be reusing the transducer amplifier for a later lab, so build it
in a corner of the breadboard and don't take it apart at the end of lab.
